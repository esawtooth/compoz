compoz

compoz is a Music Composition Framework that specifies the basic elements
on music (based on the western framework) in a programmatic fashion
including scales, chords, rhythm elements etc. The goal is to be able to
describe a piece of music that one expects to compose with some degree of
vagueness and allow it to help compose the piece within that definition
with human input. compoz is NOT about computerized creativity.
