This is where we shall define the tuning systems compoz will use.
There are several types including pythogorean, well tempered, meantone
etc.

The objective of a tuning class is to specify a set of notes with
corresponding frequencies that shall be used as the basis for our music.

These notes shall define the base scale for the composition.


Assumptions:

There will be n notes in a tuning each of different frequency (0<n).
There exists a base note for the tuning that shall always be notated as
"zero".
Each tuning system has a time period wherein the "zero" repeats.
